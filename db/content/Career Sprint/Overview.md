### LMS Tracker: (mouse movements, clicks, keypresses, and scrolling)

- User Activity Tracking: Monitor user interactions with the LMS to determine active learning time. This includes tracking mouse movements, clicks, keypresses, and scrolling.

- Session Timers: Start a timer when a user logs into the LMS or opens a learning resource and stop the timer when they log out or close the resource. Reset the timer after a period of inactivity (e.g., 5 minutes).

- Inactivity Detection: Implement a mechanism to detect inactivity (e.g., no mouse or keyboard activity for a certain period) and pause the active learning timer.

Data Logging: Store the active learning times in a database for each user session.
