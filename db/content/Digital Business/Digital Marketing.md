## What is Digital Marketing?

Digital marketing refers to the use of digital channels, such as search engines, social media, email, and websites, to promote products, services, or brands. Unlike traditional marketing, which relies on print media, television, and radio, digital marketing leverages online tools and platforms to connect with consumers where they spend much of their time—on the internet.

## Why is Digital Marketing Important?

1. **Reach and Visibility:** Digital marketing allows businesses to reach a global audience. With the right strategies, companies can make their products and services visible to potential customers around the world.
    
2. **Targeted Advertising:** Digital marketing enables precise targeting of ads based on user behavior, interests, and demographics. This ensures that marketing efforts are directed at the most relevant audience.
    
3. **Cost-Effective:** Compared to traditional marketing methods, digital marketing often offers more affordable options with measurable results. Businesses can track their return on investment (ROI) more effectively.
    
4. **Engagement and Interaction:** Digital marketing facilitates direct interaction with consumers. Through social media, email, and other channels, businesses can engage with their audience, receive feedback, and build relationships.
